## neodotfiles

Over here in nix-land, we have ascended beyond dotfiles simply declaratively
specifying your zshrc and vim config and other `*rc` files. No, over here we
can deal in declaratively specified entire systems, in installed packages.

Anyway, the point is this repository contains the nix-gunk I use to configure
some of my machines.
Not all of my dotfiles are migrated in, some machines are partial (due to
secrets, privacy, or other reasons), and some of this may not work at all.

Please feel free to borrow snippets or take inspiration from this, but *caveat emptor*.
